In this project we are automating the process of logging in, registering into a web page and also inputing data. The we test each data input from the excel file if its valid or not as we input it.

## This is what is happening in my Automation project:
So firstly I am using the UiPath community app and instead of using the modern design experience, I used the classic design experience.
  
  ### Steps
      1. We read the data in each spreadsheet
      2. Click the login button
      3. If you are not yet registerd as user in the system click the link below named "register as a new user" which will take you to the registering page
      4. Once you get to your registering page, Type your email and password then confirm your password into the textboxes
      5. Check whether the password and the confirmed password are the same before logging in
      6. Click the register button, that way you have already logged into the system
      7. (ELSE IF) If you are already a user the you cna just type your email and password into the given textboxes
      8. Click the remember me checkbox
      9. Click the log in button to log into the system
      10.
